This framework takes in audio input, transcribes it to text, and uses it for voice identification. It then extracts relevant persona attributes and retrieves user data from a vector database. Tt combines persona details with conversation history, and creates a context-aware prompt for the LLM to generate a personalized response. Finally, the system updates temporary records to improve future interactions, to establish a more adaptive and engaging experience.
